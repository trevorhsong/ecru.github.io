Over my 6 years at Stern, I feel extremely blessed to get to know so many brilliant and benevolent people, who provide me with gratuitous care, ignite my passion for life, and deepen and enlarge my understanding and vision. I am forever indebted to my advisors, Wenqaing Xiao, Maxime Cohen, and Ilan Lobel, and my coauthors, Alex Jacquillat, Lian Qi and SÃ©bastien Martin.

<p>
My academic journey would not be initiated without guidance and support from Yuriy Zinchenko and Warren Hare.
</p>
<p>
Exile was my destiny, yet I have now chosen to return to my birthplace. 
My top 3 places on the planet: NYC, Calgary, and Hangzhou.
